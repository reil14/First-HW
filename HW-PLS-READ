     I'm Jeoffrey Vergara, I graduated from Lourdes School of Mandaluyong. Going to college is a new role for me. From 2011-2014, I will be studying game design and development. This is a new thing for me because this is the most stressful part of my life for now, but its also fun at the same time. Its like studying while having fun. I'm also a new friend to my blockmates. 

     Part of my new routine is riding two trains when going to school. Its also my first time eating outside the school on my break time.
