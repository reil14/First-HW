     I'm Jeoffrey Vergara, I graduated from Lourdes School of Mandaluyong. Going to college is a new role for me. From 2011-2014, I will be studying game design and development. This is a new thing for me because this is the most stressful part of my life for now, but its also fun at the same time. Its like studying while having fun. I'm also a new friend to my blockmates. 

     Part of my new routine is riding two trains when going to school. Its also my first time eating outside the school on my break time. Budgeting my time is also a new routine for me. Everything that I do in school has to be timed and be on time. Budgeting my allowance is also a new thing for me because back in high school I used to save my allowance to buy shoes.
   
     Part of being in college is having new friends and teachers. Bonding time with your friends is a must. For me, having a strong relationship with your friends will help you go through college me. Having more friends will help you in your studies as well in your stay in college. For me more friends equals more fun.

     I really want to try studying hard because in my high school days I used to be chill and be relaxed all the time. I hope that college will be as fun as high school.
